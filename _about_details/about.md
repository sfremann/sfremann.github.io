# Hello there!

I’m a developer with a strong background in computer science and mathematics, 
passionate about RPGs and narrative games, as a creator and as a gamer.
In my free time, I like writing dark fantasy stories with unnecessarily 
complex characters and lore. I also like when it’s fun. Everyone needs a good laugh 
once in a while, even in a dark and depressing world.

Being both an artist and a programmer with a slightly maniacal obsession for 
problem-solving and mathematics, I’ve always struggled to decide whether to do creative 
or technical work. I also just figured out I could create some nice tools to help integrate 
creative content into games such as animation, cinematic or VFX – anything to help fellow game 
developers and artists to bring high-quality games to life, with compelling and authentic storytelling.
