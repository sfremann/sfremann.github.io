# Digibuild

### 10/2024 - present

Research project aiming to improve cooperation between construction and manufacturing companies through better control of production from a digital model (BIM).
Researchers at Hasselt University focused on developing tools to visualise and interact with BIM models in-site using XR technologies. 

- Developed, integrated, presented and recorded Unreal Engine demonstrators.
- Enabled real-time BIM annotation in XR with user interaction and interfaces, and automation tools in Python to update ifc files with the changes made in XR.
- Improved reusability and maintainability by reworking the architecture into modular plugins.
