# VR Haptics (Research Project)

### 02/2024 - 06/2024

Research project with the Digital Future Lab (previously EDM, Expertise Centre for Digital Media), a research centre of Hasselt University. 
Unreal Engine demonstrators used in a large-scale user study (150+ participants) evaluate the impact of haptic feedback and VR on consumer behaviour in online high-end product purchasing.

- Designed and implemented Unreal Engine demonstrators while communicating with multidisciplinary stakeholders.
- Modified TouchDIVER Haptic Gloves API to issue simple commands from Unreal Engine.
- Streamlined the user study with Python automation tools.
